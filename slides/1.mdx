## Meet the Gamepad API

The browser's built in way to handle gamepad input using JavaScript.

```js
window.addEventListener('gamepadconnected', (e) => {
  console.log(
    'Gamepad connected',
    e.gamepad.index,
    e.gamepad.id,
    e.gamepad.buttons.length,
    e.gamepad.axes.length
  )
})
```

# But what about React?

- Adding/removing event listener on mount/dismount
- Syncing input with component state
- Component level, vs global

# Introducing <br /> react-gamepads

A set of **hooks** and **utilities** for using the **Gamepad API** inside React.

Use a hook, get access to gamepad input -- _it's that easy_.

</Box>

---

<Box textAlign="left">

# How does it work?

1. Attaches (and removes) event listeners with `useEffect()`
1. Stores game input as a "ref"
1. Returns latest game input _every frame_ as a hook or context

</Box>

---

<Box textAlign="left">

# How do you use it?

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { useGamepads } from 'react-gamepads'

export default function App() {
  const [gamepads, setGamepads] = useState({})
  useGamepads((gamepads) => setGamepads(gamepads))

  return <div>{gamepads[0].buttons[4].pressed}</div>
}
```

</Box>

---

_It's that simple._

---

<Box textAlign="left">

# Why game input?

- Make your app accessible to non-keyboard users
- Introduce classic game control paradigms to the web
- Make games!

</Box>

---

# Basic Examples

<Box width="100%" display="flex" sx={{"& h2": {flex: 1}}}>

## Menu interaction

## Cursor navigation

## "Horse" game
